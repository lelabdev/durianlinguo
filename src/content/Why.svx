### **Learn Bisaya, the Way It’s Spoken in Davao**

**Why I’m Building This App**

I’m not from here. I’m French. When I moved to **Davao**, I didn’t just want to live in the city — I wanted to *belong*. And that meant learning the language people actually speak every day: **Bisaya**.

But I quickly realized there's almost no learning material for Bisaya - no apps, no structured courses, nothing made for beginners. Even in bookstores or libraries, all i found were a few old dictionaries, often hard to use if you're starting from zero.

So I decided to build something simple: a free app to help people learn basic Bisaya from English — the kind of words you actually need when you’re buying *taho*, asking for directions, or just saying “thank you” the right way.

It’s not about becoming fluent.
It’s about learning **300 core words** — enough to connect, to show respect, and to feel a little more at home.

The app uses simple flashcards, repetition, and small interactive lessons — nothing fancy, but effective. Think of it like a friendly language buddy in your pocket.

Right now, it’s still in development. I’m building it step by step, between work and life, because I believe this should exist. It’s not open source *yet* — I want to get the first version right — but that’s the goal. One day, I hope others can help improve it, adapt it, or even build their own tools from it.

And who knows — maybe later, we can add the reverse: helping Bisaya speakers learn basic English too. But for now, let’s start with the basics.

Because if you live here, if you love this place, you should be able to speak its language — not just survive in it.

This app is for Davao.
For newcomers.
For curious minds.
For anyone who wants to say *“Durian gyud!”* and actually know what it means.

### **Want to help shape it?**

This is more than just an app — it’s a small project born from respect for the language and culture of Mindanao. And I can’t do it alone.

I’m looking for:
- 🎨 **Designers** to help refine the look (yes, even the durian logo can improve),
- 🗣️ **Native Bisaya speakers** to record words or check translations,
- 💬 **Teachers or language lovers** who want to help structure the basics,

If you’re passionate about Bisaya and want to help make learning it easier for others — **I’d love to hear from you**.

*P.S. “Durian gyud!” doesn’t mean “I love durian.” (Though I do.) It means something like “Seriously!” or “For real!” — the kind of phrase you’ll actually use. Just like the app.*
